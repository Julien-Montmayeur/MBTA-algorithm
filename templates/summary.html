  <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
  <p>MBTA Subway Expansion Algorithm</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project presents a data-driven tool to support transit infrastructure decisions for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).
    It models neighborhood-level needs, feasibility, and cost efficiency to recommend subway and rail extension projects optimized under various planning priorities.
  </p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    Boston continues to face critical transit access gaps and growing congestion. Rather than relying solely on qualitative planning documents,
    this tool introduces a quantitative algorithm to score and prioritize potential projects based on real-world metrics.
    The goal is to help planners and decision-makers identify which projects bring the greatest benefit within a fixed budget.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    Each Boston neighborhood is evaluated on population, income, growth rate, distance from transit, transit dependence, and construction feasibility.
    The tool supports three scenario modes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Climate Focus</strong> — prioritizes transit-dependent, lower-income communities to reduce emissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost Saving</strong> — prioritizes low-cost, high-feasibility projects to maximize returns per dollar.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth Focus</strong> — targets high-growth, underserved areas with long-term impact.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Projects are scored using a weighted algorithm and selected using a budget-constrained optimization loop. The model supports multiple build options per neighborhood (e.g., surface rail vs tunnel) and ranks them by strategic score per cost.
  </p>

  <h2>Outputs</h2>
  <p>
    The tool produces:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A ranked list of selected projects</li>
    <li>Mode-based investment summaries</li>
    <li>Project justifications based on equity, cost, and feasibility</li>
    <li>A “Gap Index” measuring how close unselected neighborhoods were to qualifying</li>
    <li>A scenario comparison table showing overlap and divergence between strategies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real-World Relevance</h2>
  <p>
    The algorithm draws on real MBTA planning concepts like the Urban Ring and commuter upgrades. It reflects the type of scoring and filtering processes that transportation agencies use in practice. 
    This prototype can serve as a conversation starter for integrating algorithmic thinking into city planning, particularly for climate-aware, equity-driven infrastructure investments.
